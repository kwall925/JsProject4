<Promises/Fetch>


JS == Synchronous

AJAX == Asynchronous
    -xhr.send --> send request
    -V 
    -Next line will execute while request is sent
    next line cannot depend on the request
    -Asynchronous == next line executes regardless
    of request status


onreadystatechange function == callback
    (callback executes when ready state changes)


Promises
    V
Resolve/Reject
    V
.then()
    V
.catch()


Resolve == Data is retrieved

Reject == Error has occured

.then() == Runs code after


Async...Await
    -just a different way to resolve 
    promises
    -declare a function as async...
    -await will asign the eventual 
    resolved value from promise


Fetch API
    fetch(url)    //default is "GET"
        V 
    Response  (promise)
        V
